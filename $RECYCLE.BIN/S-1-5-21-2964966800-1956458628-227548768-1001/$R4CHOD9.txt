compiler v/s interpreter

1 it check error
2 convert into machine code language
3 execution

but the compliler doesn't take responsibility of exicution 

and c++ is compiler base language
 java script always run inside browser
 interpreter exicute program
 it doesn't make exe file for java code
 in interpreter language it run the code n time
